# Basic Calculator

Basic Calculator app built using the React library. This was the first thing I built using React and was, therefore, heavily refactored as I learnt more about the framework. It still needs further refactoring.

## To be finished/fixed/refactored...

* Main calculation function is far too big and needs breaking down into smaller functions
* Multiplication and division
* Tests need adding

## Prerequisites

You will need the following things properly installed on your computer.

* [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
